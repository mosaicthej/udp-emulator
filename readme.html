University of Saskatchewan

Assignment 2: Media Access Control - Network Layer<br>
</h1>
<b>Instructor:</b> Dwight Makaroff <br>
<b>Out: </b>February 6, 2024<br>
<b>Due:</b> 9:30PM, March 5, 2024 <br>

<p>Total Marks: 60.

<P> <b>Part A: MAC Layer Protocols </b> (9 marks).

<p>
For all questions in Part A, show your work, so part marks can be
given for correct reasoning, but faulty mathematical execution.

<ol>
<li><p>
<i>(3 marks)</i>

Give the checksum for 10111011001 using CRC with generator 10111.

</ul>

<li><p>
<i>(3 marks)</i>
Give the ratio of the propagation delay &tau; to the frame transmission
time <i>t</i> for each of the following wireless (i.e., use the speed of
signal propagation through air) networking scenarios (round each
answer off to 2 significant figures), and state for each which of
ALOHA or CSMA would do better:

<ul>
<li type="a"> approx 50 meter distance between nodes, 100 Mbps Data
  rate, 2 Kbit frames.
<li type="a"> approx 5 kilometer distance between nodes, 100 Mbps Data
  rate, 2 Kbit frames.
<li type="a"> approx 200 meter distance between nodes, 10 Gbps Data
  rate, 20 Kbit frames.
</ul>
</li>

<li>
(3 marks) Requiring all transmissions to be synchronized into slots is
known to increase the efficiency of slotted ALOHA over that of "pure"
(unslotted) ALOHA. However, under light load, the slotted protocol
suffers from longer delays because nodes must wait for the next slot
before they transmit. As a compromise, consider "mini-slotted" ALOHA,
where the slot size is reduced to 1/B of the frame transmission time
t. Each transmission must still begin at a slot boundary, but now it
occupies the channel for a block of B consecutive slots. (Note that
slotted ALOHA is the B=1 case, and unslotted ALOHA is obtained in the
limit as B gets big.) As a function of B and t, what is the length of
the "vulnerable period" in mini-slotted ALOHA?
</ol>


<p> <b>Part B: Network Layer Protocols </b> (11 marks).

As well, show your work for these questions.
<ol>
<li><p>
<i>(4 marks)</i>
Consider the following graph in which the nodes represent routers,
the edges represent links, and the labels indicate the link costs.

<ul>
<li type="a"> 
Show the shortest path length estimates after each step when
Dijkstra's algorithm is applied to the above network with node C as
the source.
<br>

<li type="a"> 
(4 marks)
Suppose now that <i>distance vector</i> routing is used, and that each minute
all nodes <i>simultaneously</i> send routing updates to their
neighbours. Consider those updates relating to the path lengths to
node C. Let D<sup>x</sup>(C) denote node <i>x</i>'s estimate of 
its shortest path length to node C. Each minute, each node <i>x</i>
sends D<sup>x</sup>(C) to each of its neighbours, and simultaneously
receives D<sup>y</sup>(C) from each of its neighbour
nodes <i>y</i>. Node x will then update D<sup>x</sup>(C) to 
the minimum over all neighbours <i>y</i> of D<sup>y</sup>(C)
plus the cost of the link between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. Supposing
that link CB fails, give a table showing the evolution of the
D<sup>x</sup>(C) 
values for all nodes <i>x</i> (except C) until these
values stabilize. For the first row of the table, use the shortest
path lengths when there are no link failures. Note that because of the
assumed synchronous operation, the D<sup>x</sup>(C) values in one row
will reflect the current link costs together with the D<sup>y</sup>(C)
values in the <b>previous</b> row.

<li type="a"> 
(3 marks)
Repeat part (b), but now assuming use of <i>poisoned reverse</i>.


</ul>
</ol>

<p> <b>Part C: UDP Protocol Socket Programming</b> (40 marks)
<p>
In this question your task is to design and implement a protocol that
provides reliable message delivery over UDP, as well as to design and
implement "network emulation" code that will enable testing of your solution.

<ol>
<li type = "a">
(20 marks) 

Design and implement a simple <b>UDP-based</b> network emulator. Your
program should take as parameters a drop probability <i>p</i>, a delay
value <i>d</i>, a maximum queue size <i>q</i>, and three port
numbers <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>. Your emulator should listen
for incoming UDP segments on port <i>A</i> (which should also be used
for transmitting outgoing segments). When a UDP segment is received
(with source port of either <i>B</i> or <i>C</i>) the emulator 
should discard it with probability <i>p</i>. With probability <i>1-p</i>, the
emulator should queue the segment for delivery to port <i>B</i> if the source
port of the segment is <i>C</i>, and to port <i>C</i> if the source
port is <i>B</i>. There should be two separate queues, one for
segments to be sent to <i>B</i>, and one for segments to be sent
to <i>C</i>. Each queue should be able to accommodate <i>q</i>
segments; if the queue to which a new incoming segment should be added
is full, the incoming segment should be discarded. Each segment should
spend time <i>d</i> in the queue before being 
sent out (after which it should be removed from the queue). It should
be possible to test your network emulator using <i>netcat</i>.

<li type = "a">
(20 marks) 
Implement a <b>client</b> and <b>server</b> using <b>UDP-based</b>
communication to provide reliable delivery using a 
<b>selective repeat</b> protocol. You may existing solution
for UDP programs as the starting point for the main components
of the client and server, as in Beej's network guide. You can combine
your network emulator with these programs to have examples of a lossy
network. Show some information at the server/client for how many
packets/acknowlegments succeed, how many fail, and how much
retransmission is necessary, based on various choices for the 3
parameters from part a. You don't need a systematic study to be done,
but a few examples would be sufficient.

</li>

</ol>

<p>
<b>FINAL NOTE:</b> All programming practises required for CMPT 332 must be
followed:
<ul>
<li>Check the return values from system calls
<li>Check the command-line parameters
<li>Compile with -Wall -pedantic. (We want C, not C++, and code should
	compile with zero warnings) -std=gnu90 is optional.
<li>Name, NSID, and Student number in EVERY FILE.
<li>Any more defensive programming measures that come to mind.
</ul>


<h3> Hand In Instructions</h3>
<p>

Create a directory for this assignment:
<ul>
  <li> Place in this directory your assignment including the following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>N separate PDF documents named QuestionPartX_Y.pdf (where X is
    the part number and Y is the number of the question).
    <li>Source code, header files, and makefile to compile the various
    binary programs.
    <li>Git logs for your progress and proper version control
    practises.
    <li>Design document: <tt>Design.txt</tt>.
    <li>Testing showing message transmission and reception
  </ul>

  <li> Now you are ready to hand in your assignment. To do so you are
going to make a <span style="font-weight: bold;">tar</span> file, and
upload it to Blackboard's assignment hand-in. All files in the main
directory of the tar file, <b>no subdirectories</b>.
A marking script will then untar the assignment. Please do not gzip
    the file. I've had problems with 
different students using different versions of the compression program
and it just takes too much TA time, or requires a more complicated
    script to extract the necessary files.</li>
  <li> That's it - you are done.</li>
</ul>
